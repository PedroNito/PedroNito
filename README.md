# Hi there 👋

</div>
 
 ## ABOUT ME ✍️

<div>

I'm Pedro Nito, a technology enthusiast passionate about creating innovative solutions and solving problems.

I'm a fullstack developer dedicated to building immersive and functional experiences. From developing responsive and attractive frontends to developing robust and secure backends, I'm committed to delivering comprehensive, high-quality solutions.

I always seek to innovate and learn new things, because everything is constantly evolving and we have to keep up with the pace, so I firmly believe that knowledge takes up no space.

In my free time, I enjoy building with Legos, traveling to explore new cultures, challenging myself in escape rooms, and appreciating nature. I believe in the importance of balancing work and leisure for a fulfilling and productive life.
